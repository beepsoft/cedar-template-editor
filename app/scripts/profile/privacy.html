        <h4>Information Collected</h4>

        <p>We offer a number of services that do not require you to register for an account or provide any personal
          information to us. In order to provide our full range of services, we may collect the following types of
          information:

        <ul>
          <li>Information you provide - When you become a registered user, we ask you for personal information (such as
            your
            name, email address and an account password). We also offer you the opportunity to customize your individual
            profile.
          </li>

          <li>Cookies - When you visit the Center for Expanded Data Annotation and Retrieval web service, we send one or
            more
            cookies - a small file containing a string of characters - to your computer that uniquely identifies your
            browser.
            We use cookies to improve the quality of our service by storing user preferences and tracking user trends,
            such as
            how people search. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to
            refuse
            all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features and services of the Center
            for
            Expanded Data Annotation and Retrieval may not function properly if your cookies are disabled.
          </li>
          <li>Log information - Our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit
            a
            website. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol address,
            browser
            type, browser language, the date and time of your request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify
            your
            browser.
          </li>
          <li>Navigation commands - As you navigate our custom web application services, the Center for Expanded Data
            Annotation
            and Retrieval may collect information about your actions in order to understand and optimize the user
            experience
            offered by the web application services.
          </li>
          <li>User communications - When you send email or other communication to the Center for Expanded Data
            Annotation
            and
            Retrieval, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests
            and
            improve our services.
          </li>
          <li>Embedded URLs - In order to provide maximum site utility, the Center for Expanded Data Annotation and
            Retrieval
            may
            also use a tracking technique that uses embedded URLs to allow use of the site without cookies. Embedded
            URLs
            manifest themselves as plain text or encoded extensions to the URL that appears in the browser address or
            location
            toolbar. This technology allows limited information to follow you as you navigate the site, but is not
            identified
            to
            personal data and is not used beyond the session. While this increases your ability to surf the site, it
            does
            not
            replace the functionality or streamlining of cookies and may limit your use of many convenience features
            offered
            by
            the site.
          </li>
        </ul>
        </p>

          <li>Providing our services to users, including the display of customized content</li>
